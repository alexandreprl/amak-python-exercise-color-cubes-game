<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Exercise

Given a warehouse divided in multiple areas and cubes of different colors, the goal is to group cubes of the same color
in the same area.
To do that, multiple robots are available. Each robot can move to any area and pick up a cube. The robot can then move
to another area and drop the cube.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Click on "Use this template" then "Create a new repository"
* Clone your new repository
* Create a virtual environment `python -m venv .venv` (Optional)
* Activate the virtual environment `source .venv/bin/activate` (Optional)
* Install dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Run the simulation `python simulation.py`

### Notes

For each exercise, you are expected to design the solution on paper before implementing it.

### Exercise 1

The exercise is to implement the robots' behavior to group cubes of the same color in the same area.

Areas do not have a specific color, they can receive cubes of any color.

Robots can only carry one cube at a time.
Robots cannot directly interact with each other.
Robots do not have a specific color, they can pick up cubes of any color.

The solution must work for any number of areas (greater than or equal to number of colors), colors, robots (>0) and
cubes.
The solution must support the addition/removal of robots, packages, colors, and areas at runtime.

### Initial state

- Each area has a random number of cubes of random colors
- Robots are placed randomly in an area of the warehouse

### Expected result

- All cubes of the same color are grouped in the same area
- An area only contains cubes of the same color
- Robots are not carrying any cube

### Questions?

- Is it possible for the system to solve the problem without allowing robots to directly communicate?
- Can robots exchange information without direct communication?

### Exercise 2

Allow robots to communicate with each other.

Agents can communicate using mailboxes:

```java
// Send a message to the agent neighbor1
self.tell(neighbor1, "message")

// Read the message from the mailbox
var message = self.read_message()
if message is not None:
    // Do something with the message
```

### Exercise 3

Update the solution so that robots can pick up to four cubes
